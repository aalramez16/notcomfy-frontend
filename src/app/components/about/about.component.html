        <h2>About the Comics</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://notcomfy.com"><span class="main-link-area">notcomfy</span></a> is an attempt to create visual aides for some of my wackier ideas.
            Some of the comics are meant to be funny. Others are meant to make you wince. Some are meant to show a fun new way to look at something mundane
            about the world. Either way, I hope that you find something worthwhile in these comics :)

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Ali, and I've been making art for as long as I can remember. Growing up with the internet at my fingertips means
            webcomics have been something I've loved for yearsâ€”only recently have I gotten into making my own. By day I'm a software developer in
            Cleveland, Ohio. Given the more technical nature of my work, <a href="https://notcomfy.com"><span class="main-link-area">notcomfy</span></a> has been an opportunity to 
            keep myself involved in art, which is something very important to me.
